# advent-of-code-2024
My solutions to the advent of code challenges, written in various languages, and using AI.

My tactic/goal is to complete each day using any/all tools I can to solve the problems offline. This includes 

### --- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---

### --- Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports ---

### --- Day 3: Mull It Over ---

### --- Day 4: Ceres Search ---

### --- Day 5: Print Queue ---

### --- Day 6: Guard Gallivant ---

[Guard Gallivant](./days/6)
![Maze solver example](./img/maze_solver.png)

Using Pygame, A simple path-finding maze solver for part 1, and a less-than-efficient permutations tester for part 2.
If I were to sit down and optimize this challenge, I would only test placements of walls along the walking path from part 1.

### --- Day 7: Bridge Repair ---
Process the input file, eval base2 then base3 iteration through the operators.
The most annoying part of this one was the left-to-right eval instead of obeying the order of operations.
